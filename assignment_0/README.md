### Five topics I enjoy related to computing, in no specific order:
1. Web design --

    Since my last computer science class, I've spent a lot of time working with the basics of web design, both server- and client-side. I really enjoy the wide potential of versatility of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I think a lot of people are appropriately befuddled with CSS, but it's becoming one of my favorite languages as I get to know it better. 

2. Cybersecurity --

    Since my last computer science class, I've also spent some time learning the basics of cybersecurity [via creating a login system], and while I'm not super stable or well-versed in my knowledge or experience, I enjoy keeping an eye on what ethical hackers are doing.

3. Machine Learning --

    I've spent some time lately learning about the general premise/pattern/methods of machine learning, and I've yet to have any real experience with it myself, but I find it really fascinating and enjoyable. A YouTube channel, b2studios, puts out awesome videos of training AI neural networks to perform tasks [such as bowling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWjUY_3ubf4), which are endlessly entertaining.

4. Numbers? --

    This isn't really a field of computing, but I am fascinated by hexadecimal/binary/octal/base64. Stumbling across them in the wild is like seeing a celebrity at the grocery store. I think they're super useful and they always remind me of inventive and creative solutions to problems.

5. Database design --

    While experimenting with web design, I have gained some more experience with database design specifically with SQLite. This could also be labelled as "data structures" as it is more about how the data is structured (at least, that is why I list it), but I wanted to be a little more specific. SQLite's limitations in datatypes has challenged how I think about data structures, and I've come to really like this new way of thinking, especially understanding how much easier it makes specific data queries.

### Five topics that are difficult right now, in no specific order:
1. Computer architecture --

    Playing with [NandGame](https://www.nandgame.com/) has challenged me to think differently, much like SQLite. I'm enjoying it so far, but I am anticipating a lot of difficulty as I get to know a different language of logic.

2. Git CLI --

    I've had a couple (mild) experiences of screwing up and losing a lot of progress by trying to set up a repository using the CLI. I put it on this list because I'm also taking CS140U, and I've been working on getting better with more advanced CLI tools in general. It's something I have wanted to get better with for some time, but wasn't quite ready for until a few weeks ago. I still rely on GUIs.

3. Physics engines -- 

    I generally understand the concept of forces and velocities and positions, but I lack experience and tend to rely on a lot of tutorials/guides for getting the results I want. I list this because I would like to be a little more skilled in physics simulations, mostly for game design/interactive applications. Similar but not distinct/interesting enough for its own spot on the list: 3D modelling. I understand a lot of the concepts in theory, but rely on tutorials to get results.

4. Network systems --

    Another thing I do not have a lot of experience with. I don't quite understand network configurations. I have a general understanding of IP addresses and other basics, but any server configuration I would need a lot of help setting up. I have plans to build a personal media server, following a tutorial, that I hope will teach me some basics.

5. UML diagrams --

    I know how do make a UML diagram for a grade, but I haven't ever really utilized them in personal projects. I have tried to draw one in the late stages of planning a project, or even during a project re-structure, but ultimately it didn't work out for me. Even if I don't specifically use the UML format, I would benefit from some diagrams in my project planning/documentation.
